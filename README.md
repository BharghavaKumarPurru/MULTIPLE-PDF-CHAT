## Demo
[Include a demo link or image of the interface here if available.]
## Overview
The **MULTIPLE-PDF-CHAT** project is a chatbot application that leverages LangChain, Streamlit, and the ChatGPT API to provide an engaging and efficient experience for users interacting with uploaded PDFs. This solution allows users to upload multiple PDFs containing company-related documents, such as employee guidelines or company overviews, and receive instant answers to their queries based on the content of the PDFs. The chatbot uses AI models integrated via Huggingface for enhanced functionality and accuracy.

## Features
- Upload multiple PDFs containing company-related documents (e.g., employee guidelines, company overview).
- Interactive chatbot to answer user queries based on uploaded documents.
- Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **ChatGPT API**, and **Huggingface** models.
- Provides quick and accurate responses to users without needing to navigate through the entire document.
- Easy to deploy and extend for use in various company domains.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **LangChain**: For integrating language models and enhancing data processing.
- **ChatGPT API**: For generating intelligent, conversational responses.
- **Huggingface**: For model integration and optimization.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MULTIPLE-PDF-CHAT.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
